PLASMA provides routines to solve dense general systems of linear equations,
symmetric positive definite systems of linear equations and linear least squares
problems, using LU, Cholesky, QR and LQ factorizations. Real arithmetic and complex
arithmetic are supported in both single precision and double precision.

PLASMA has been designed to supercede LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, principally by
restructuring the software to achieve much greater efficiency, where possible,
on modern computers based on multicore processors. PLASMA also relies on new or
improved algorithms. Currently, however, PLASMA does not serve as a complete
replacement of LAPACK due to limited functionality. Specifically, PLASMA does
not support band matrices and does not solve eigenvalue and singular value
problems. Also, PLASMA does not replace ScaLAPACK as software for distributed
memory computers, since it only supports shared-memory machines.
