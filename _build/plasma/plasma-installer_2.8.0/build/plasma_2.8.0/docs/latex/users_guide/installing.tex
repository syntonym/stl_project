\chapter{Installing PLASMA\label{install}}

%###################################################################################################

The requirements for installing PLASMA on a UNIX\textsuperscript{TM} system are
a C compiler, a Fortran compiler and several external libraries:
\begin{itemize}
\item a BLAS library
\item a CBLAS library
\item a LAPACK library
\item a Matrix generation library (TMG from LAPACK)
\item a C wrapper for LAPACK library
\item and the availability of the \textsf{pthread}
library.
\item The HWLoc library is also strongly recommended but not absolutely required. (\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/})
\end{itemize}
Several BLAS libraries include directly a part of this
requirements. You can refer to the table \ref{tab:extlibs} to see what
is provided by your BLAS library. 
For requirement and instructions on Microsoft Windows\textsuperscript{TM}
see Section~\ref{sec:wininstall}.
Before PLASMA can be built or tested, you must define all machine-specific parameters
for the architecture on which you are installing PLASMA.
All machine-specific parameters are contained in the file
\texttt{make.inc}. Some examples are provided in the \texttt{makes}
directory. 
To ease the installation process, we provide an installer which can
download the missing libraries from NetLib, install them and generate
the required machine-specific \texttt{make.inc} file. Users 
are strongly encouraged to use it.

\section{Getting the PLASMA Installer}

The PLASMA installer is a set of python scripts developed to ease
the installation of the PLASMA library and of its requirements. It can
automatically download, configure and compile the PLASMA library
including the libraries required by PLASMA.

It is available on PLASMA download page:
\begin{link_url}
\url{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/software/}
\end{link_url}

\section{PLASMA Installer Flags}

Here's a list of the flags that can be used to provide the installer
with information about the system, for example, the C and Fortran
compilers, the location of a local BLAS library, or whether the
reference BLAS needs to be downloaded.

\begin{verbatim}
./setup.py

   -h or --help
          display this help and exit

   --prefix=[DIR] 
          install files in DIR [./install]

   --build=[DIR] 
          libraries are built in DIR [./build]
          Contains log, downloads and builds.

   --cc=[CMD] 
          the C compiler. [cc]

   --fc=[CMD] 
          the Fortran compiler. [gfortran]

   --cflags=[FLAGS] 
          the flags for the C compiler [-02]

   --fflags=[FLAGS] 
          the flags for the Fortran compiler [-O2]

   --ldflags_c=[flags] 
          loader flags when main program is in C. Some
          compilers (e.g. PGI) require different
          options when linking C main programs to
          Fortran subroutines and vice-versa

   --ldflags_fc=[flags] 
          loader flags when main program is in
          Fortran. Some compilers (e.g. PGI) require
          different options when linking Fortran main
          programs to C subroutines and vice-versa.
          If not set, ldflags_fc = ldflags_c.

   --make=[CMD] 
          the make command [make]

   --blaslib=[LIB]

          connection, you can provide the following packages
          in the directory builddir/download:
     http://netlib.org/blas/blas.tgz
     http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/cblas.tgz
     http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack.tgz
     http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/plasma/pubs/lapack_cwrapper.tgz
     http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/plasma/pubs/plasma.tar.gz

   --[no]testing 
          enables/disables the testings. All externals
          libraries are required and tested if enabled.
          Enable by default.

   --nbcores 
          The number of cores to be used by the testing. [2]

   --clean

\end{verbatim}

The installer will set the following environment variables 
\begin{verbatim}
	OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
	GOTO_NUM_THREADS=1
	MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
\end{verbatim}
in order to disable multithreading within BLAS. \textbf{IMPORTANT} Do
not forget to set those environment variables for any further usage of
the PLASMA libraries.

\section{PLASMA Installer Support}

Please note that this is an alpha version of the installer and, even though
it has been tested on a wide set of systems, it may not work. If you
encounter a problem, your feedback would be greatly appreciated and
would be very useful for improving the quality of this installer.
Please submit your complaints and suggestions to the PLASMA forum:

\section{Tips and Tricks\label{tips}}

\subsection{Tests are slow}
If the installer is asked to automatically download and install a BLAS
library (using the \texttt{--downblas} flag), the reference BLAS from
Netlib is installed and very low performance is to be expected.  It is
strongly recommended that you use an optimized BLAS library (such as
ATLAS, Cray Scientific Library, HP MLIB, Intel MKL, GotoBLAS, IBM ESSL,
VecLib etc.) and provide its location
through the \texttt{--blaslib} flag.

\subsection{Installing BLAS on a Mac}
Optimized BLAS are available using \texttt{VecLib} if you install the
Xcode developer package provided with your Mac OS installation CD.  On
MAC OS/X you may be required to add the following flag.
\begin{verbatim}
--ccflags="-I/usr/include/sys/"
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Processors with Hyper-threading}
The PLASMA installer cannot detect if you have hyper-threading enabled
on your machine, if you donâ€™t use HWLoc library. In this case, we
advise you to limit the number of cores for the initial testing of the
PLASMA library to half the numbers of cores available if you do not
know your exact architecture.  Using hyper-threading will cause the
PLASMA testing to hang.  When using PLASMA, the number of cores should
not exceed the number of actual compute cores (ignore cores appearing
due to hyper-threading).

\subsection{Problems with Downloading}
If the required packages cannot be automatically downloaded (for
example, because no network connection is available on the
installation system),
you can obtain them from the following URLs and place
them in the build subdirectory of the installer  (if the directory does not exist, create
it):
\begin{description}
\item[BLAS] Reference BLAS written in Fortran can be obtained from
\begin{link_url}
\url{http://netlib.org/blas/blas.tgz}
\end{link_url}
\item[PLASMA] The PLASMA source code is available via a link on the download page:
\begin{link_url}
\url{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/software/}
\end{link_url}
\end{description}


\section{PLASMA under Windows}
\label{sec:wininstall}
We provide installer packages for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries on
Windows available from the PLASMA web site.  
\begin{link_url}
\url{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/software/}
\end{link_url}
These Windows packages are created using Intel C and Fortran compilers
using multi-threaded static linkage, and the packages should include
all required redistributable libraries.  The binaries included in this
distribution link the PLASMA libraries with Intel MKL BLAS in order to
provide basic functionality tests.  However, any BLAS library should
be usable with the PLASMA libraries.

\subsection{Using the Windows PLASMA binary package}
Using the PLASMA libraries requires at least a C99 or C++ compiler and a
BLAS implementation.  The \texttt{examples} directory contains several examples
of using PLASMA's linear algebra functions and a simplified makefile
(\texttt{Makefile.nmake}).  This file provides guidance on how to
compile and link C or Fortran code using several different compilers
(Microsoft Visual C, Intel C, Intel Fortran) and different BLAS
libraries (Intel MKL, AMD ACML) in 32- or 64-bit floating-point precisions.
The examples in \texttt{Makefile.nmake} will have to be adjusted to the
appropriate locations of the compilers and libraries.

You \textbf{need} to make sure that the BLAS libraries are being used
in a sequential mode, either by linking with a sequential version of the
BLAS libraries, or by setting the appropriate environment variable for
that library.  PLASMA manages the parallelism on a machine and it will
cause substantial performance degradation and a possible hang of the code
if the BLAS calls are also running in parallel.

\subsection{Building PLASMA libraries}
Rebuilding the PLASMA libraries should not be required, but if you
wish to do so, the tested build environment uses Intel C and Fortran
compilers, Intel MKL BLAS, and the CMake build system.  This build
enforces an out-of-source build to avoid clobbering pre-existing
files.  The following example commands show how the build might be
done from a command shell window where the path has been setup for the appropriate
(either 32-bit or 64-bit) Intel environment.
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icl 
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icl -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
\end{verbatim}

Native threading API (as supplied with modern Windows systems starting
with Windows 2000) is used to provide parallelism within the PLASMA code.
Wrapper functions translate any PLASMA threading calls into native Windows
thread calls.  For example, the \textsf{\_beginthreadex()} function is called
to spawn PLASMA threads.
